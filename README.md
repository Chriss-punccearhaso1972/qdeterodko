Just waltzed out of the theater after watching Alarum and honestly, I can’t decide if I’m inspired or just... annoyed. First off, why does every character have to look like they tragically walked out of a 90's grunge music video? Is it supposed to be gritty? Edgy? Who knows! The art department really went to town on that one.

> And then there’s the soundtrack—oh man, it was like being trapped inside a malfunctioning jukebox. What were they thinking? At some point, I swear I heard whale sounds mixed with techno beats. Who decided that was a good idea? It’s like they were trying too hard to make it iconic or something, but instead it felt like being stuck in a club you didn’t wanna be in. Even the DJ seems lost.

The plot? Don’t even get me started. It twists and turns like a snake stuck on a treadmill, while I’m here just trying to figure out if we’ve actually moved forward or if we’re still stuck in the introduction. Halfway through, I realized I was kind of rooting for the villain. But then again, you’d root for anything just to make sense of it all.

Did I like it? Maybe? I was strangely intrigued. It’s like getting a tattoo—painful, confusing, but you're sort of proud afterwards? Or maybe not. Maybe it's just there and you can't get rid of it. Like that song stuck in your head that you definitely didn’t ask for. I think I might have to download the movie and watch the movie again to figure out whether it's genius or a hot mess. Or maybe just a mess.

int main() { 
    float confusionLevel = 0.0f; 
    while(youWatching) { 
        confusionLevel += 0.5f; 
    } 
    return 0; 
}

Weirdest imagery thrown up by my brain? The lead actor resembled a goldfish in a blender with all that constant panic on his face. But maybe that’s just me projecting after two hours of constant chaos unfolding onscreen. Would I recommend it? “Recommend” is a strong word. Go see it, then let me know if you get it. I might just need a nap now.
